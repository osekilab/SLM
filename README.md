# Modeling Overregularization in Children with Small Language Models

This project is used in the following paper:

- [Akari Haga, Saku Sugawara, Akiyo Fukatsu, Miyu Oba, Hiroki Ouchi, Taro Watanabe, Yohei Oseki. Modeling Overregularization in Children with Small Language Models. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2024, Aug 2024.](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-acl.865/)

This repository contains two scripts:
- `data_generation/`
Data genetation scripts to assess language models' preference for overregularization
- `nanoGPT/`
A smaller implementation of nanoGPT, currently in preparation.
